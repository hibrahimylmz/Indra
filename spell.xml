			<p>You manipulate the flow of time in a small area, rapidly altering the age of objects in the area as you choose. Select any number of non-magical objects of size Small or smaller in a 5 foot cube within range. Choose fast-forward/reverse as the area's effect.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Fast-Forward:</strong> Ink dries, water boils, and candles burn down to stubs. You speed up time for the objects, causing them to experience 10 minutes for every minute spent casting the spell.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Reverse:</strong> Rotting apples freshen, torn documents are mended, and shattered vases become whole. You reverse the aging process for the objects, causing them to appear as they did 10 minutes ago for every minute spent casting the spell.</p>
			<p class="indent">In either case, this spell does not affect any object's physical location in space, and nothing outside of this area is affected. For example, a page torn from a book is not transported back to its binding if the page is outside the spell's area.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a bonus action, you can switch between the Fast-Forward and Reverse effects within a single casting of this spell.</p>
