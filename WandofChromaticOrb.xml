	<!-- Fernian Ash Wand (Fire) -->
	<element name="Wand of Chromatic Orb (Fernian Ash)" type="Magic Item" source="Homebrew" id="ID_HOMEBREW_MAGIC_ITEM_WAND_CHROMATIC_ORB_FERNIAN_ASH">
		<description>
			<p>This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the chromatic orb spell from it, but you can only choose fire damage (associated with the Fernian Ash wood from which the wand is made). For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.</p>
			<p class="indent">The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.</p>
